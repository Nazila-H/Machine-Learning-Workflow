## Machine Learning classification workflow 
The idea is implementing the different machine learning classification models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.


### Challenges:

Explore the Titanic dataset<br/>
Doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br/>
Create features using one-hot encoding<br/>
Train a Logistic Regression classification model<br/>
Calculate the train and validation accuracy<br/>
Train a Random Forest classification model<br/>
